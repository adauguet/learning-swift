 - Define a `Vehicle` class.
 - Add a `speed` property of type `Float` to the `Vehicle` class. There is also something not to forget!
 - Define a `Car` class. Make it inherit from `Car`.
 - Define a `Brand` enumeration with a few known car brands cases.
 - Add a `brand` property of type `Brand` to the `Car` class.
 - Define a `Bicycle`. Make it a subclass of `Car`.
 - Add a `hasBasket` boolean property to the `Bicycle` class.
 - Instantiate a few `Bike` and `Car`.
 - Since they all are of `Vehicle` type, you should be able to group them in an array of `Vehicle".
 - Extract the first element of the array. Can you ask its `brand`, or `hasBasket` ? Why?
